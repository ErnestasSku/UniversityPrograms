This course was one of the electives for the mathematics category during 5th semester. Some of the topics discussed and implemented: 

- One dimensional optimization
    - Golden section method
    - Interval halving method
    - Newton method
- Optimization without constraints
    - Gradient descent
    - Steepest descent
    - Deformed simplex method
- Liniear optimization:
    - Penalty method
- Non-linear optimization:
    - Simplex method
